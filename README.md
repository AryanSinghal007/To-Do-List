# To-Do List Application

This is a simple to-do list application that allows users to create and manage multiple to-do lists for various purposes such as work, school, personal, and more. Users can add, delete, and modify the content of each list, making it easy to stay organized and track tasks effectively.

The application is built using the following technologies:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to execute server-side code.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used for handling routing and request/response handling.
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A view engine that generates HTML markup with JavaScript templates.
- HTML: The standard markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages.
- CSS: A styling language used for enhancing the visual presentation of the application.
